# Password Hashing with SHA-256

This is a simple C# program that demonstrates how to hash passwords using the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function. The project includes two main files:

- `hashPassword.csproj`: The project file.
- `Program.cs`: The C# source code.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the solution in your C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).

3. Build and run the project.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to see how password hashing works for different inputs.
